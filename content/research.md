#### Preferences over Media Content and Political Accountability 
##### [_draft soon available_]
##### Abstract:
Media have become more segmented with news and entertainment content easier to
access separately and, therefore, easier to substitute. In this paper, I study how relative
demand for news and entertainment affects political accountability. In a two-period
principal-agent model, voters allocate their time between news and entertainment.
This affects an incumbent politicianâ€™s behavior as the news might inform about political corruption. When entertainment is favored over news, the greater substitutability
leads to higher rent extraction by politicians. As a result, subsidizing journalism may
not increase the equilibrium consumption of news if people can access entertainment
from other sources. I discuss potential policies to enhance public scrutiny and thereby
improve voter welfare. This framework helps explain the ongoing decline of local journalism in many democratic countries.
