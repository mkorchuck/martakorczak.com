#### Preferences over Media Content and Political Accountability
<span style="font-size:0.7em;">[draft coming soon]<\span>
Abstract:\
<span style="font-size:0.7em;">Media have become more segmented with news and entertainment content easier to access separately and, therefore, easier to substitute. In this paper, I study how relative demand for news and entertainment affects political accountability. In a two-period
principal-agent model, voters allocate their time between news and entertainment.
This affects an incumbent politician’s behavior as the news might inform about political corruption. When entertainment is favored over news, the greater substitutability
leads to higher rent extraction by politicians. As a result, subsidizing journalism may
not increase the equilibrium consumption of news if people can access entertainment
from other sources. I discuss potential policies to enhance public scrutiny and thereby
improve voter welfare. This framework helps explain the ongoing decline of local journalism in many democratic countries.</span>
