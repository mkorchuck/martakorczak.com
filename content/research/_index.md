#### Separating News from Entertainment:
#### The Political Risks of Unbundled Media Consumption
<span style="font-size:0.65em;">[Draft-November 2024](/workspaces/martakorczak.com/static/uploads/Media_paper_Nov29.pdf)</span> \
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">  This paper investigates the political implications of unbundling news and entertainment in the era of digital media. I use a two-period principal-agent model to analyze the effects of voters' time allocation between entertainment and news on political accountability. Increasing substitutability between news and entertainment reduces public scrutiny and enables politicians to engage in rent-seeking behavior if voters prefer entertainment. The model rationalizes the empirical decline of local journalism, highlighting the limits of conventional policy interventions like subsidizing news production. The findings emphasize the need for targeted strategies to reshape consumer preferences for news, which would enhance the media's role in democratic accountability. This research contributes to the political economy of media literature by reframing voter information acquisition as an opportunity cost problem influenced by evolving media markets.</span> \

<span style="font-size:0.8em;"> We constructed a survey targeted to master students at Economics departments in Italy in which we ask about the preferences towards a course assessment during a hypothetical Ph.D. program (the weight 100% put on exams or 50% on exams and 50% on research proposal). Among other outcomes, we estimate a "willingness-to-pay" in the foregone amount of scholarship for a given type of assessment. </span> \

#### Consequences of the loss of capital status on municipal socio-economic outcomes
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">Exploiting the administrative reform in Poland in 1999, I aim to examine the impact of losing the status of a regional capital on a set of socio-economic outcomes. Using a novel dataset on circa 800 municiplities in Poland, I aim to build a synthetic diff-in-diff model to estimate the effects causally. </span> \

#### Assessing the impact of abortion restrictions on women’s and infant’s health outcomes in Poland
<span style="font-size:0.8em;"> with Monika Raulinajtys-Grzybek and [Alessandro Tarozzi](https://sites.google.com/site/alessandrotarozzi/home)\
Poland and fourteen U.S. states have restricted abortion in 2021 and 2022, making them the only high-income countries having passed regressive reproduction laws in recent years. In the case of Poland, the abortion law before the restriction had already been one of the strictest in Europe. The 2021 restriction furthermore banned abortions on embryo-pathological grounds, which in 2019 constituted 98% of legal abortions in Poland. Now abortion is only permitted in cases of rape, incest, or a threat to the mother’s health and life. How has this law affected the health outcomes of infants and women? We answer this question with hospital-level data in Poland. This study aims to contribute to the relatively scarce literature on the impact ofrestrictive abortion laws on the health outcomes of both infants and women in a high-income country. </span>
