#### Losing capital status: does it matter for a city's development?
##### [Draft - August 2025](/uploads/Capitals_draft_August.pdf)
<span style="font-size:0.8em;"> How do changes in the administrative hierarchy of cities impact their development? This paper focuses on losing a regional capital status, using the context of the 1999 administrative reform in Poland.  Exploiting variation in administrative statuses, I compare ex-capitals to newly created ``city-counties" and county seats to construct a causal estimate of losing capital status. I find that ex-capital cities experienced a persistent decline in public sector activity, female labor force participation, fertility, and local public good provision, despite receiving higher central government transfers. These results are consistent with a simple theoretical model where a fall in administrative capacity induces sectoral employment reallocation and delayed migration responses. The findings highlight that administrative status is important for city-level development and that the loss of such status has negative consequences, even when paired with increased fiscal autonomy. </span>\

#### The Political Risks of Separating (Local) News from Entertainment
<span style="font-size:0.8em;"> This paper examines how consumer preferences for news and entertainment affect political accountability, particularly in the context of the transition from traditional to digital media. As news and entertainment content are easier to access separately, consumers can more readily substitute news with entertainment. Using a two-period principal-agent model, I analyze how voters' time allocation between these two options influences an incumbent politician's rent-seeking behavior. The model shows that when entertainment is favored over news, the increased substitutability leads to higher rent-seeking behavior by politicians. As a result, subsidizing journalism may fail to boost news consumption if entertainment remains easily accessible. I conclude by discussing potential policy interventions aimed at strengthening public scrutiny and improving voter welfare. This framework helps explain the ongoing decline of local journalism in many democratic countries. </span> \

#### Is Your Faculty All Male Because of Tenure Requirements?<br>Experimental Evidence From Economics Job Market Candidates

We investigate the effect of tenure requirements on the supply of female candidates for academic positions in Economics. Economic research is known for having a “leaky pipeline”: Despite high early-stage academic achievements, only few women reach tenured positions. Within a hypothetical choice experiment, we aim to quantify the willingness of PhD candidates in economics to give up salary, low teaching loads, or prestigious positions for jobs with less stringent tenure requirements. We hypothesize that high publication requirements for tenure deter female economists from pursuing a career in academia. Our findings aim to inform policies to retain female talent in academia. </span>


#### Abortion ban and health outcomes of women and infants
<span style="font-size:0.8em;"> with and [Alessandro Tarozzi](https://sites.google.com/site/alessandrotarozzi/home)\
Poland and fourteen U.S. states have restricted abortion in 2021 and 2022, making them the only high-income countries having passed regressive reproduction laws in recent years. In the case of Poland, the abortion law before the restriction had already been one of the strictest in Europe. The 2021 restriction furthermore banned abortions on embryo-pathological grounds, which in 2019 constituted 98% of legal abortions in Poland. Now abortion is only permitted in cases of rape, incest, or a threat to the mother’s health and life. How has this law affected the health outcomes of infants and women? We answer this question with hospital-level data in Poland. This study aims to contribute to the relatively scarce literature on the impact ofrestrictive abortion laws on the health outcomes of both infants and women in a high-income country. </span>\

#### An evaluation of integration policies for Ukrainian refugee children in Poland

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused an enormous inflow of refugees into Poland, including many children. About 350,000 Ukrainian school-aged children entered Polish schools, but integration is challenging, both because of the traumatic transition, difficult historical experiences, and because Polish and Ukrainian are related, but distinct, Slavic languages. Also, older students sometimes only attend online courses offered in Ukraine. To help children with schoolwork and integration, schools can hire “cross-cultural assistants” (CCAs). CCAs have to know Polish but are not required to have a degree in pedagogy, although most used to be teachers in Ukraine before the war. However, currently, there are approximately 140 refugee pupils per CCA. Such low numbers are problematic both for children’s learning and social integration, and because they leave many Ukrainian refugee teachers outside of the school system. Recently, the Polish government has decided to increase the number of CCAs (the objective is to have 1 CCA per 20 Ukrainian pupils), which until now were often funded irregularly by donors. This policy change, planned to be implemented as early as January 2025, offers an opportunity to study how CCAs can improve the integration of Ukrainian refugee children into Polish schools, through a collaboration between EUI researchers with researchers and stakeholders in Poland. Furthermore, the project aims to broadly study the case of a large-scale influx of refugees from Ukraine into Poland, in order to gauge how the learning and social integration of refugee children is affected by the presence of support teachers who are themselves refugees from the same country.</span>
