#### The Political Risks of Separating<br>(Local) News from Entertainment
<span style="font-size:0.7em;">  Voters no longer rely on daily TV news broadcasts or newspapers to learn about political matters.<br>In 2023, the average American devoted merely 37% of daily media consumption time to traditional media channels,<br>a significant decline from 68% in 2011. This trend reflects a broader change in media markets:<br>where traditional media once bundled news with entertainment—compelling viewers to consume both—digital technologies
now enable more granular, independent consumption patterns.<br> Consumers can now selectively subscribe to movie streaming services or specialized news platforms, rendering news
and entertainment increasingly economic substitutes.<br>In this paper I show how this decoupling of media consumption can affect political outcomes, focusing on the rent-seeking
behavior of politicians.<br>My results are especially relevant for relatively smaller constituencies
(subnational: regional or municipal), where political journalism might be at larger risk of
bankruptcy than at the national or international level. </span> \

<span style="font-size:0.8em;"> We constructed a survey targeted to master students at Economics departments in Italy in which we ask about the preferences towards a course assessment during a hypothetical Ph.D. program (the weight 100% put on exams or 50% on exams and 50% on research proposal). Among other outcomes, we estimate a "willingness-to-pay" in the foregone amount of scholarship for a given type of assessment. </span> \

#### Loss of capital status: does it matter for a city's development?
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">Exploiting the administrative reform in Poland in 1999, I aim to examine the impact of losing the status of a regional capital on a set of socio-economic outcomes. Using a novel dataset on circa 800 municiplities in Poland, I aim to build a synthetic diff-in-diff model to estimate the effects causally. </span> \

#### Abortion ban and health outcomes of women and infants
<span style="font-size:0.8em;"> with Monika Raulinajtys-Grzybek and [Alessandro Tarozzi](https://sites.google.com/site/alessandrotarozzi/home)\
Poland and fourteen U.S. states have restricted abortion in 2021 and 2022, making them the only high-income countries having passed regressive reproduction laws in recent years. In the case of Poland, the abortion law before the restriction had already been one of the strictest in Europe. The 2021 restriction furthermore banned abortions on embryo-pathological grounds, which in 2019 constituted 98% of legal abortions in Poland. Now abortion is only permitted in cases of rape, incest, or a threat to the mother’s health and life. How has this law affected the health outcomes of infants and women? We answer this question with hospital-level data in Poland. This study aims to contribute to the relatively scarce literature on the impact ofrestrictive abortion laws on the health outcomes of both infants and women in a high-income country. </span>\
