#### Preferences over Media Content and Political Accountability
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">[draft coming soon]</span> \
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">Media have become more segmented with news and entertainment content easier to access separately and, therefore, easier to substitute. In this paper, I study how relative demand for news and entertainment affects political accountability. In a two-period principal-agent model, voters allocate their time between news and entertainment.
This affects an incumbent politicianâ€™s behavior as the news might inform about political corruption. When entertainment is favored over news, the greater substitutability
leads to higher rent extraction by politicians. As a result, subsidizing journalism may
not increase the equilibrium consumption of news if people can access entertainment
from other sources. I discuss potential policies to enhance public scrutiny and thereby
improve voter welfare. This framework helps explain the ongoing decline of local journalism in many democratic countries.</span> \

<span style="font-size:0.7em;"> We constructed a survey targeted to master students at Economics departments in Italy in which we ask about the preferences towards a course assessment during a hypothetical Ph.D. program (the weight 100% put on exams or 50% on exams and 50% on research proposal). Among other outcomes, we estimate a "willingness-to-pay" in the foregone amount of scholarship for a given type of assessment. </span> \
