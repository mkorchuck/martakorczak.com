## Cześć!
Welcome to my website. I am a PhD candidate in Economics at European University Institute in Florence. My supervisors are [David K. Levine](http://www.dklevine.com/david.htm) and [Alessandro Tarozzi](https://sites.google.com/site/alessandrotarozzi/home).\
I use micro-econometric and experimental tools, as well as microeconomic theory, to answer questions from areas of political economy, public economics and gender.\
\
In the past I worked at the Polish central bank and at the International Monetary Fund in Warsaw. Then, I went to Barcelona to train as an applied microeconomist and I continued my path in academia as a PhD student in Florence.
